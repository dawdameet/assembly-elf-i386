# Assembly ELF i386 Extension

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1-blue)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/)
[![VSCode Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/badge/VSCode-Marketplace-green)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/)

A Visual Studio Code extension for `elf_i386` assembly language, providing syntax highlighting, autocomplete, hover documentation, snippets, and more.

---

## Features

### 1. **Syntax Highlighting**
- Highlights assembly instructions, registers, directives, comments, strings, and numbers.
- Example:
  ```asm
  section .data
      message db "Hello, World!", 0

  section .text
      global _start

  _start:
      mov eax, 4          ; sys_write
      mov ebx, 1          ; stdout
      mov ecx, message    ; pointer to message
      mov edx, 13         ; length of message
      int 0x80            ; interrupt
  ```

### 2. **Autocomplete**
- Provides real-time suggestions for:
  - Instructions (`mov`, `add`, `sub`, etc.)
  - Registers (`eax`, `ebx`, `ecx`, etc.)
  - Directives (`section`, `global`, `extern`, etc.)
- Context-aware suggestions (e.g., suggest registers after `mov`).

### 3. **Hover Documentation**
- Displays detailed descriptions when hovering over instructions, registers, or directives.
- Example:
  - Hovering over `mov` shows:
    ```
    **mov**

    Moves data between registers or memory.
    ```

### 4. **Snippets**
- Predefined code snippets for common patterns:
  - Define a section: `section`
  - Declare a global symbol: `global`
  - Insert a `mov` instruction: `mov`

### 5. **Linting**
- Detects common errors in assembly code (e.g., invalid instructions or undefined labels).

### 6. **Boilerplate Generator**
- Includes a command to generate boilerplate assembly code:
  - Command: `Generate Assembly Boilerplate`.
